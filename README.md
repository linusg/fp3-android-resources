## OTA update ZIP files

The OTA update ZIP files are hosted on `https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/fairphone_fp3_fp3`. Unlike on the FP2 there's no Fairphone-specific updater app, instead system updates are performed by the *Google Play services* app (invoked via *Settings ðŸ¡’ System ðŸ¡’ Advanced ðŸ¡’ System update*).

The release dates below aren't official but rather the date on which the update is first received and mentioned by a FP3 user.
